# Professional Self-Assessment
  Completing the Computer Science Program at SNHU has given me multiple opportunities to design, implement, and provide documentation for large-scale applications and solutions to industry problems. I started this program with only basic knowledge of Java and C++, but completed it by learning various languages, skills, and tools. I became proficient in languages like Python, JavaScript, and HTML to deliver a multitude of client-server architecture solutions. I also became familiar with tools like OpenGL for model rendering, Android Studio for mobile architecture & programming, and the MEAN Stack suite of tools that I utilized to deliver extensive functionality for the application Travlr Getaways, which was implemented through the course of the CS-465 Full Stack Development course.
	This program has shaped my strengths and employability in many ways. This capstone requires a code review video, accompanying narratives, and a cohesive collection of GitHub Pages that display my ability to deliver professional communication regarding design choices, implementation, and associated tools for delivering a product. Delivering many unique solutions and completing the capstone proposed enhancements has also improved my proficiency in data structures and algorithms, software engineering, and databases, all while honing my mindfulness of security.
# Software Design and Engineering Artifact:
	For this milestone, I took a project I developed in CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance using Java and Junit, and converted it to Python and Pytest. This enhancement will exemplify the ability to design, test, and validate software in multiple languages. Being able to deliver consistent functionality across multiple languages is an ideal skill that exemplifies how one can support a variety of development environments and organizations.
# Algorithms and Data Structures Artifact:
	For this milestone, I took a project I completed in CS 340: Client/Server Development and applied database algorithmic enhancements in the form of pagination, aggregation pipeline functionality, and a basic TTL Cache. The skills that will need to be exemplified for this portion of the assignment are an understanding of MySQL commands and database concepts. 
# Databases Artifact:
	For this milestone, I enhanced a project I completed in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming by using it as a framework to implement a mobile application that populates its UI with TV show data retrieved from the Tvmaze API. This enhancement will exemplify the ability to assess and integrate third-party APIs to deliver an application that utilizes an extensive database and adheres to effective software security practices.
